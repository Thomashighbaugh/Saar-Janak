# Saar-Janak
A web app to make a random background for websites https://saar-janak.netlify.com

## Introduction

This is a relative simple web application that will draw a background using JS that the user can use for website backgrounds, desktop wallpapers or whatever their heart desires!

## Using the Backgrounds
For the time being there is no way that I know of to make the images available to you through the web application, so instead I'd reccomend using a screenshot tool. 

While I have no idea what is available on Windows or Mac, on Linux there is a handy program called Shutter that I like quite a bit. Shutter enables you to take a screenshot based on a selection of your screen, enabling you to use the background on your sites. 
```bash
# to install shutter on >= Ubuntu 19.04
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/shutter -y
sudo apt-get install shutter -y 


# To Install Shutter on Ubuntu <19.04 
sudo apt-get install shutter -y 
```

There are several additional options for Linux as well, such as Flameshot and most browsers now come equipped with their own screen capturing programs. So pick your poison and get to making some killer web sites.
